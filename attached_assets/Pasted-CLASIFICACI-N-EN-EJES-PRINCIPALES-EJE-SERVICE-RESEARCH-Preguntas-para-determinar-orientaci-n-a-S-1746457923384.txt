CLASIFICACIÓN EN EJES PRINCIPALES
EJE SERVICE ↔ RESEARCH


Preguntas para determinar orientación a SERVICIO:
"Is there already a working product or service?
>Evaluates whether the subnet has a working product that users can interact with"
"Does it offer clear, immediate utility?
>Evaluates whether users or other systems can already benefit from its outputs."
"Is there a current and obvious revenue model?
>Assesses if the project is already making money or has a monetization plan."
"Are there real-world use cases already implemented by third parties?
>Validates if outside developers or businesses are actually using the subnet."
"Are there measurable usage or adoption metrics?
>Seeks evidence that people are actually using the service."
"Is the documentation geared toward implementation?
>Checks if the docs are practical and help others build or integrate quickly."

Preguntas para determinar orientación a RESEARCH:
"Are they solving deep problems that don’t have clear solutions yet?
>Evaluates whether the subnet is focused on frontier exploration, not application."
"Does it conduct open research with public results?
>Assesses if research findings and developments are shared publicly"
"Is the team’s background more academic or research-heavy?
>Assesses if the core contributors have experience in science or R&D."
"Does the roadmap prioritize breakthroughs over monetization?
>Looks at whether the focus is progress and discovery, not short-term revenue."
"Are they working on emerging or experimental technologies?
>Evaluates how cutting-edge or exploratory the project is."

EJE INTELLIGENCE ↔ RESOURCE

Preguntas para determinar orientación a INTELLIGENCE:
"Is its main value in intelligent processing?
>Evaluates if the computational tasks require significant AI or algorithmic intelligence"
"Does it take real expertise to join and contribute?
>Assesses how much skill or knowledge is needed to be useful in the subnet."
"Is it generating new knowledge or insights?
>Evaluates whether it creates value by solving or learning, not just running tasks."
"Does it facilitate emergent intelligence?
>Evaluates if the subnet enables new forms of intelligence to emerge from interactions"
"Does the system learn, adapt, or improve over time?
>Checks for dynamic, self-improving capabilities in the subnet."

Preguntas para determinar orientación a RESOURCE:
"Is it resource-efficient relative to its purpose?
>Evaluates if the subnet uses computational resources efficiently"
"Does it have high hardware requirements?
>Assesses the level of hardware needed to participate."
"Is it more of a utility than a brainy system?
>Checks whether the subnet is about availability and throughput, not intelligence."
"Does location matter a lot for performance?
>Assesses if physical placement (latency, jurisdiction) affects the subnet."
"Is there a direct correlation between provided resources and rewards?
>Looks for subnets where more hardware equals more TAO"
"Is distributed availability or redundancy a core feature?
>Evaluates if reliability and uptime are one of the subnet’s selling point."
